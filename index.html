        <p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses
           Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.

            Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger.
            Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”
            including adding support for source control systems (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software
            development lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).</p>
            
            <p>A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in
                 which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any
                 computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often
                 refers to a system used to control one or more servers.</p>
